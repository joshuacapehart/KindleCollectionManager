KindleCollectionManager
=======================

A cross platform Kindle collection manager

Introduction
---------------------------
This Kindle collection manager has been created because of the general lack of a good, simple, cross-platform application of its type.
Alternatives do exist, but all have distinct limitations: 
  - Calibre with plugin
    - Must install Calibre, which is a heavyweight solution. Some people want this anyway, but not all.
    - Not a very intuitive UI.
  - Amazon Kindle app
    - No Linux version, not cross-platform
  - Python script located at http://kcollect.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/kcollect
    - Very unintuitive, practically worthless for non-programmers
    - No simple way to use without additional scripts or lots of tedious typing

Goals
----------------------------
This Kindle collection manager should:
  - Be cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac at least)
  - Have a reasonably intuitive GUI
  - Be lightweight
Optional goals are:
  - Scriptable
